# Referee Testing Environment for the Polish Quidditch League

This is the source code for the PLQ's referee testing portal which you can visit here: <https://ref.polskaligaquidditcha.pl>

It's an F# + Suave application, made with security in mind. If you find any bugs, please submit an Issue, describing when, what happens.

## The application is still under development
After I finish it, there will be more documentation available here.

Current roadmap:

- [x] User can login
- [x] User can register
- [x] User can take a test
- [x] User can viewtheir profile
- [ ] User can edit their profile
- [x] User can browse the referee catalog
- [ ] Admin has an easier life managing tests and users (if there's time)
